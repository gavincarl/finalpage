          You are nothing but rats to the nobles of this grim burg. Born from the Dregs, raised by paupers, no money to your name. The others told you that the rest of your family left decades ago, and have not been heard from since. The leader of your people, Jareth of the Dregs, was wrongfully convicted and hung for the assassination of Erigar Stridand, Duke of Estor. The new Duke, Baylok the Brawn, is militiantly stripping the walls of any being not of noble blood. You and your brethren of the Dregs are destined for chained labor in the fields of the surrounding villages, under strict enforcement. That is, of course, if they can catch you before you escape..
